# Jeep Air Down Web Interface

Jeep Air Down is an ESP32-based project for automatically managing the tire pressure of an off-road vehicle. The ESP32 runs in access-point mode, creating its own WiFi network and serving a mobile-friendly web interface for real-time control and monitoring.

**How it works:**
- A pressure sensor measures the tire pressure through the fill hoses.
- One solenoid valve connects the tires to a compressed air source (for airing up).
- Another solenoid vents air from the tires (for airing down).
- The user connects the tires to the system, sets the desired pressures, and the system automatically adjusts each tire, freeing the user to focus on other tasks.

  - One relay/solenoid connects the tires to a compressed air source (for airing up).
  - Another relay/solenoid vents air from the tires (for airing down).
- The pressure sensor is plumbed into the air line to measure the current tire pressure and is connected to an analog input on the ESP32.
- The user connects all four tires to the system via hoses and can control the process from their phone or computer.

**Description:**

- The ESP32 is powered by a 12V supply via the barrel jack, which also powers the relay shield and solenoids.
- The relay shield receives control signals from the ESP32 (GPIO12, 13, 14, 25), but only relays 1 and 2 are used for fill and vent solenoids.
- The relay shield's V_in is connected to 12V and jumpered to the common terminals of relays 1 and 2, allowing the NO (normally open) contacts to switch 12V to the solenoids.
- The solenoids' other wire is connected to relay shield GND.
- The pressure sensor is powered from the ESP32's 5V output, with its signal connected to analog input GPIO32 (A0).
- **Two pushbuttons are connected to the ESP32 for manual control:**
  - Air Up Button: Connect one side to GPIO5, the other to GND (active low, internal pull-up enabled)
  - Air Down Button: Connect one side to GPIO16, the other to GND (active low, internal pull-up enabled)
- The user connects the system to all four tires via hoses; the ESP32 web interface and/or physical buttons control the relays to air up or down as needed.

## Updating Default Setpoints

The default setpoints for "On Road" and "Off Road" are stored in `setpoints.json` in the project directory. To change the defaults:

1. Open `setpoints.json` in a text editor.
2. Change the values for `setpoint_onroad` and `setpoint_offroad` as desired (e.g., `{ "setpoint_onroad": 34, "setpoint_offroad": 16 }`).
3. Save the file.
4. Upload the updated `setpoints.json` to your ESP32 using Thonny (see below).

  - `microdot.py` (from [Microdot GitHub repo](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/microdot/tree/main/src))
  - `style.css` (for web app styling)
  - `setpoints.json` (default setpoints: On Road = 32 PSI, Off Road = 14 PSI)

### 2. Connect ESP32 to Your Computer
- Plug in your ESP32 via USB.
- Open Thonny IDE.
- Set the interpreter to "MicroPython (ESP32)" (bottom right corner).

### 3. Upload Files to ESP32
- In Thonny, use the left pane to browse to the project folder on your computer.
- Right-click `main.py` and `microdot.py`, then choose "Upload to /" to copy them to the ESP32.
- Confirm both files appear under "MicroPython device" in Thonny's file browser.

### 4. Reboot ESP32
- Press the reset button on the ESP32, or use "Stop/Restart backend" in Thonny.
- Watch the Thonny shell for output. You should see something like:
  ```

## Optimizing Performance with mpy-cross

### What is mpy-cross?
`mpy-cross` is a cross-compiler that converts MicroPython `.py` files into precompiled `.mpy` bytecode files. This has several advantages for ESP32 projects:

- **Reduced memory usage**: `.mpy` files consume less RAM when imported
- **Faster import times**: No need to compile code on the ESP32
- **More stable WiFi**: Less memory pressure helps maintain WiFi connectivity
- **Improved startup time**: The ESP32 boots faster with precompiled modules

### Installation

#### Option 1: Install via pip (Easiest)
```bash
# For any platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
pip install mpy-cross

# Verify installation
mpy-cross --version
```

#### Option 2: Download binary

1. **Download mpy-cross**:
   - Visit the [MicroPython GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases)
   - Find the latest release that matches your MicroPython firmware version
   - Download the appropriate mpy-cross for your OS (Windows/Linux/Mac)

2. **Windows Installation**:
   ```
   # Extract the downloaded zip file
   # Add the mpy-cross directory to your PATH or use the full path
   ```

3. **Linux/Mac Installation**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x mpy-cross  # Make executable
   sudo mv mpy-cross /usr/local/bin/  # Move to path (optional)
   ```

### Compiling Libraries

```bash
# Basic usage
mpy-cross microdot.py

# For specific architecture (if needed)
mpy-cross -march=xtensawin microdot.py
```

This will create a `microdot.mpy` file that can be uploaded to the ESP32 instead of the `.py` version.

### Uploading Compiled Files

1. In Thonny, right-click the `.mpy` file and select "Upload to /"
2. Delete the corresponding `.py` file from the ESP32 if it exists
3. The ESP32 will now use the `.mpy` file automatically

### Recommended Libraries to Compile
- `microdot.py` â†’ `microdot.mpy` (significant memory savings)
- Any other third-party libraries you're using

**Note**: Don't compile `main.py` or files you frequently modify during development.

---

## Troubleshooting
- If the web page does not load, ensure your phone is connected to the ESP32 WiFi and not using cellular data.
- If you see errors in Thonny, check that both `main.py` and either `microdot.py` or `microdot.mpy` are present on the ESP32.
- The captive portal may not automatically pop up on iOS; manually visit [http://192.168.4.1](http://192.168.4.1).
- If you experience WiFi connectivity issues, try using the `.mpy` compilation approach described above to reduce memory pressure.
